# Music Assistant Snapclient #

[Music Assistant](https://music-assistant.io/) can make use of [Snapcast](https://mjaggard.github.io/snapcast/) to stream to devices. It also has a web client that Music Assistant makes available if enabled.
Using this you can stream your library to your computer, or add your computer as a spekaer without installing software.
This is a small page that iframes the Music Assistant and Snapclient interface into once screen with the Snapclient section being hideable by clicking the gray bar.
If accesed form a mobile device, this won't display at all (but will load in the background).
